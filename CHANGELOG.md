# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- 📦 **PyPI install actually works now.** Hatchling's `exclude` took precedence over `artifacts`, causing every published wheel to ship without the frontend build. The app returned `{"detail":"Not Found"}` on all non-API routes. Switched to `force-include` (matching open-webui's approach), which unconditionally bundles `cptr/frontend/build` into the wheel regardless of exclude rules.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- 📦 **Attempted PyPI wheel fix (incomplete).** Changed hatchling `exclude` from a single broad pattern to granular excludes, but the `artifacts` directive still did not override `exclude`. Wheel still shipped without the frontend.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- 🔄 **Messages no longer disappear after sending.** Fixed a race condition where the frontend needed a separate GET request after sending a message, creating a window where socket events were dropped. The POST now returns the created messages directly, eliminating the round-trip and the race.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- 📋 **Plan mode.** Request an implementation plan before AI changes.

### Fixed

- 🔒 **Protected `.env` files.** File tools and search now block `.env` and `.env.*` access.

### Changed

- ✨ **Cleaner artifact cards.** Simplified assistant artifact card headers and preview text.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- 🗄️ **Alembic migration no longer fails on startup.** Renamed migration revision IDs from 3-character (`001`) to 4-character (`0001`) identifiers, fixing Alembic's `ResolutionError` for partial revision matches.
- 📦 **PyPI wheel no longer bundles frontend source code.** Fixed `.gitignore` paths (old `computr/` → `cptr/`) and added an explicit `exclude` in `pyproject.toml` so only `cptr/frontend/build` ships in the wheel — eliminating ~14,000 unnecessary files including `node_modules`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 🔄 **Chat streaming no longer drops final content.** Fixed a race where the `done` socket event arrived before the DB commit, causing a transient blank message. The streamed content now stays visible until the reload confirms it.
- 🔄 **Unflushed text no longer lost at end of chat responses.** The final text buffer is now properly flushed and emitted before marking a message as done, across all exit paths (normal completion, cancellation, and errors).
- 🔄 **Intermediate chat state persisted during tool loops.** Content and output items are now saved to the database between tool call iterations, so progress survives crashes or disconnects.
- 🧹 **In-memory task state cleaned up on completion.** The `_task_state` dict entry is now removed when a chat task finishes (done, cancelled, errored, or max iterations), preventing unbounded memory growth.
- 📱 **Sidebar stays closed on mobile.** The sidebar default breakpoint was raised to 1024px and an auto-close listener now collapses it whenever the viewport shrinks below 768px.
- 🔄 **Stale chat loads discarded.** Rapid chat switches no longer apply data from a slow earlier load, fixing a race condition that could show the wrong conversation.

### Changed

- ⚡ **All blocking filesystem I/O offloaded to threads.** File reads, writes, directory walks, search, archive creation, uploads, renames, and deletions in the workspace and tool routers now run via `asyncio.to_thread()`, preventing event-loop stalls under heavy file operations.
- ⚡ **Port scanner made fully async.** Platform-specific port scanning (Darwin `lsof`, Linux `/proc`, Windows `netstat`) and PID-to-process lookups now use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` or `asyncio.to_thread` instead of blocking `subprocess.run`.
- ⚡ **Welcome endpoint system info collected off the event loop.** The `/welcome` handler now gathers hostname, memory, disk, CPU, network, and process data in a background thread.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 📱 **Tool calls no longer overflow on mobile.** Fixed tool call rendering that could exceed the parent container width on narrow screens.
- 📱 **Settings tabs scroll horizontally on mobile.** The settings tab bar now scrolls on narrow screens instead of overflowing.

### Changed

- 🔤 **Tool call labels show filenames instead of full paths.** Tool call summaries like `Read`, `Edit`, and `Write` now display just the filename (e.g. `Read stores.ts`) instead of the full absolute path, keeping labels readable on all screen sizes.
- 📋 **Redesigned changelog modal.** The changelog is now presented as a clean, continuous vertical list with color-coded section badges.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 📱 **Improved mobile keyboard handling.** The terminal and chat now resize correctly when the on-screen keyboard opens on iOS and Android.
- 📱 **Fixed page bouncing on mobile.** Eliminated unwanted page scrolling and bounce effects on touch devices.

### Changed

- 🔄 **Model selection syncs across devices.** Your selected chat model now persists across browsers and devices instead of being saved locally.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 🛑 **File browser no longer refreshes constantly.** Replaced the macOS `PollingObserver` (which generated a feedback loop of phantom filesystem events) with the native `FSEventsObserver`. Background refreshes are now silent — no more loading spinner flash on every update.
- 🔇 **Eliminated noisy filesystem watcher events.** The watcher now ignores changes in `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store`, and `node_modules` directories, which were triggering unnecessary file browser refreshes.
- ⚡ **Centralized git status store.** All components (GitBar, GitView, FileEditor, layout) now share a single `gitStatusStore` instead of each independently polling `git/status`. On page load, this reduces git status API calls from ~6+ down to 1.
- 🔁 **Reduced git polling frequency.** Removed the 5-second git status polling intervals that were running in multiple components simultaneously.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- 🚀 **Initial release.** First public version of cptr: your computer, from anywhere. Code, manage, and control your machine from the web.
- 🖥️ **Terminal emulator.** Full PTY-backed terminal accessible from the browser with support for macOS and Linux.
- 💬 **AI chat.** Built-in chat panel with multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints), model selector, tool calling, and streaming responses.
- 🔧 **Tool system.** Extensible tool framework enabling AI agents to interact with the local filesystem, run commands, search the web (Brave, DuckDuckGo, Exa, Tavily), and read URLs. Streaming JSON parser for improved tool-calling reliability.
- 📎 **File mentions.** Type `@` in the chat input to mention files with an inline suggestion popup, giving the AI context about your codebase.
- 🔄 **Queued messages.** Queue follow-up messages while the AI is responding — they'll be sent automatically when the current response completes.
- ✏️ **Output editing.** Review and edit AI-generated file changes before applying them.
- 📁 **File browser.** Web-based file explorer with directory navigation, file viewing, file icons by extension, and management capabilities.
